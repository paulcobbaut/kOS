Experimenting with Kerbal OS

#### vostok 1
This is my first attempt at flying a rocket for 100% with kOS. The source code and craft file are in the directory, as is the boot file. There is no relation to the real Russian Vostok rockets.


kOS launches the rocket, changes heading a couple of times, does some science, opens a parachute, and ends with a splashdown in the Kerbin ocean.
